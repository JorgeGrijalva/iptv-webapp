# IPTV WebApp

A modern [React](https://react.dev/) webapp that faciliates interacting with any Xtream Codes API backend

**NOTE: This application does not provide any media, and only displays data from the user provided Xtream Codes API url**

## Goals

- Use redux + local storage to minimize API calls
- Play browser-compatible media in the browser
- Easy to use interface for searching, browsing, and viewing media
- Compatible with any Xtream Codes API backend
- No additional proxy server needed, all application logic runs entirely on the browser and interacts directly with Xtream Codes API

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner
